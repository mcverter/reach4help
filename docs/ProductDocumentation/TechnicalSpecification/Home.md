* ## [**The App**](https://app.reach4help.org)
This is our main app, connecting volunteer organizations and 150+ volunteers in 13 countries worldwide to streamline and automate help requests for communities in need. 

* [**The Map**](https://map.reach4help.org/?map=40.50557780927837%2C-89.87343211855669%2C3)
Our interactive map serves as a central repository for the global mutual-aid movement thatâ€™s arisen in the face of this crisis. We want to showcase your group as an essential community resource. People living elsewhere can also use this tool to locate aid for their loved ones who may live in your community.
