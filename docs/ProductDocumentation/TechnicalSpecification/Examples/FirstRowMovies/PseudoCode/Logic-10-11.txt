System Requirement Logic 10, 11


10. Users and visitors can complain to admins about users who wrote inappropraite comments:

// User views comments of a movie page (movieinfo.php)
// User clicks on the complain button located next to the comment
// 	if (isset($_POST['complain']))
	// located the commentID of the comment that user clicked on
	// calls user object's complainComment($commentID) method
// The admin goes to the complaints interface and sees a list of complaints
// The admin checks off the complaint and clicks either the ignore or erase button
// If the admin clicks the ignore button, 
	// Call the admin object's ignoreComplaint() method
// Else if the admin clicks the erase button,
	// Call the admin object's removeComment() and warn() methods simultaneously
// The complaint is removed from the complaints database afterwards



11. Users who are suspected to be spammers twice or were warned twice will be removed from the system:

// When a user logs in to a session, check both his spam and warn counters.
// If either his spam or his warn counter is 2 or higher,
	// The system will mark the session to terminate the account afterwards
	// The user will be notified in the homepage after his login session begins
	// When the user logs out, the system automatically deletes the user from the database
