Reach4Help is an open project that is completely run by volunteers, and is part of [Helpful Engineering](https://www.helpfulengineering.org/), a collective of volunteers who have congregated to come up with solutions in the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic, without any commercial goals.

We’re looking for more people to join our teams, if you’d like to join, please take a look at the [instructions for getting involved](https://github.com/reach4help/reach4help/wiki#onboading-steps).
