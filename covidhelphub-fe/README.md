This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
If you're not familiar with Next.js or Prism, refer to the [Learn](#LearnMore) section for tutorials. 

For this project, we expect node 14.

If it's your first time, run 
```
yarn
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

To learn how to set up a Prisma schema, use this tutorial: [Prisma in Typescript](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch-typescript-postgres) But instead of creating the schema they suggest here, use the schema in this tutorial: [Next with Prisma tutorial](https://dev.to/aryanjnyc/introduction-to-prisma-with-next-js-1l0). Once you're done with the first tutorial, then start the "Add a POST Endpoint" section in the second tutorial.

## Deploy on Vercel
Deployment to be determined.
