At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

### You will need at least `node` and `yarn` installed.

- [Download Node Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 'Download Node Here')
- [Download Yarn Here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/ 'Download Yarn Here')

#### In this repo we favour `yarn` over `npm` as the "official" package manager since we also leverage `yarn workspaces` as the manager for our `monorepo`

### Setting up the environment variables

This Project uses Services that require API keys and environment variables such as Firebase and Google Maps API.
The environment variables should be set up in a file named `.env` outside the `src` directory.

Unfortunately, we cannot provide the values for any of the keys that we use internally as it's linked to our billing account.
We have however, included the keys for a starter project in [`.env.EXAMPLE`](.env.EXAMPLE). For now, you can go ahead and rename this file to `.env` to get started on development right away.

For development purposes, we have also stubbed the response from the Google Maps Geocoding API so you don't need to obtain a Google Maps API Key with a billing account associated with it. Note that this produces a fixed location response (which shouldn't hinder your development).

We use the following data services in our stack and in the situation that we exceed the usage quotas of the starter project, please reach out to the core team or feel free to generate the credentials on your own:

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
  - Enable sign-in through Facebook (with your own Facebook app that you can make [here](https://developers.facebook.com/))
  - Enable sign-in through phone
  - Enable Cloud Firestore
  - Enable Cloud Messaging
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation) (_optional: for dynamic geolocation_)
  - [Get a Maps JavaScript API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
  - [Get a Geocoding API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key)

**NOTE:** If you are using the test credentials we provided, we had to enable `https` on localhost development server to let the live Facebook app authenticate. You'll likely see a warning from your browser about the authenticity our self-signed SSL certificate but this shouldn't cause any problems until production. For now, you can bypass the warning and proceed to start development.

## Run the project

1 - Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

2 - Run the `web-client` project in development mode.

```
cd ./web-client && yarn start
```

3 - The client is now available under [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

# React version and Functional Components

### We are on the latest version of React.

- We favour functional components and hooks to class components.
- We also prefer multiple small components to a big one
- We are leveraging `TypeScript`
- We use `styled-components` for styling
- We use Prettier and ESLint to maintain consistent code

[Check here for latest version of React](https://reactjs.org/versions)
