# Contributing Code to Reach4Help

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project.
Whether you're interested in contributing code,
or contributing in some other manner,
we're happy to have you on board!

This document describes how to contribute the software aspects of our project,
if you want to contribute by other means,
please see our [Onboarding Steps](https://github.com/reach4help/reach4help/wiki#onboading-steps).

## Please read our guidelines before you start.

This project is moving very fast at the moment,
both from development and organizational standpoints,
and so it's very important you **read this guide fully**
to reduce the additional work for our development and management teams.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time
of the team leads managing and developing this open source project.
In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue,
assessing changes, and helping you finalize your
pull requests and other contributions.

## Code contributions we are looking for.

Lots of people are working on this project at the same time,
so we try our best to explicitly assign tasks to individuals
to reduce the likelihood of duplicated or wasted effort.

Before we can assign any tasks to you,
we ask that you read and complete the process detailed in our
[Onboarding Steps](https://github.com/reach4help/reach4help/wiki#onboading-steps),
and in particular **Join a Team** if possible.

Once you have done this,
we will start being able to assign issues to you.
You may take a look at the open issues,
in particular,
those labelled
[good first issue](https://github.com/reach4help/reach4help/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
or
[help wanted](https://github.com/reach4help/reach4help/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
